# Checkers
A simple checkers program with parallelized artificial intelligence.

This is a checkers program that I initially created for my Discrete Structures
class using an AI framework for logic-based board games that we created in
class. I later added parallelization for another class. It includes "normal" and
"suicide" modes.
